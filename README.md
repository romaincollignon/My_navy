## :rocket: Introduction

    You all know the very famous Battleship game. Well, I hope so.
    You must code a terminal version of this game using signals.
    
    The two players are ONLY allowed to comunicate using the
    signals SIGUSER1 and SIGUSER2.
## ðŸ“– Documentation
    - make the binary
    - ./navy ${position_file} to initalize the game,
    - ./navy ${pid of the initialized game} ${position file} to join the game,
       and then write a position to shot your attack !
